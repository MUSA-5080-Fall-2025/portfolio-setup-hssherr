## Algorithms in Public Policy
- **What are Algorithms?**
  - Simply, a set of instructions. Typically involve rules and criteria that need to be met to achieve certain outcomes.
  - Ex. cooking recipes, directions, decision trees, *computer programs that process data to make predictions*
  - Algorithms (in theory) assist in overcoming the bias of human decision-makers by creating a set rule set
- **Terminology**
  - Inputs &rarr; functions, predictors, independent variables, x, etc.
  - Outputs &rarr; labels, outcomes, dependent variables, y, etc.
  - Data Science &rarr; computer science/engineering focus on algorithms and methods
  - Data Analytics &rarr; application of data science methods to other disciplines
  - Machine Learning &rarr; algorithms for classification and prediction that learn from data
- **Real-world examples**
  - Criminal Justice &rarr; recidivism risk scores for bail and sentencing decisions
  - Housing & Finance &rarr; mortgage lending and tenant screening algorithms
  - Healthcare &rarr; patient care prioritization and resource allocation
- **Issues with algorithms**
  - Inherent bias in the data inputs and how models were created around that biased data 
## Public Sector Context
- **How Governments Use Data**
  - Long history of government data collection and a massive amount of public data has become available over the past couple decades
  - A desire for algorithmic efficiency often results in some actions that are not typically considered desireable (i.e. mass firings to save costs)
- Data Analytics Subjectivity
  - Every step involves human choices that are inherently subjective 
    - Ex. Removal/ommission, recoding, how results are interpreted
  - Healthcare Algorithm Bias Example
    - An algorithm to identify high-risk patients systematically excluded Black patients
    - The model used healthcare costs as a proxy for need, but Black patients typically incurred lower costs due to "systemic inequities in access" to healthcare
      - i.e. Black patients were not treated as often or as extensively, resulting in less healthcare costs overall
    - Therefore, patients who were more likely to seek/afford treatment were prioritized over those who could not
  - COMPAS Recidivism Preciction Example
    - Biased policing patterns producing more Black arrests resulted in an algorithm 2x as likely to falsely flag Black defendants as high risk
  - Dutch Welfare Fraud Detection Example
    - Disproportionately targeted vulnerable populations, violated EU privacy laws

## Questions & Challenges
- **What I didn't fully understand**
  - The nuances of GitHub, but I think I'm getting most of it
- **Areas needing more practice**
  - Using GitHub

## Connections to Policy
- **How this week's content applies to real policy work**
  - Data manipulation in R will be useful for taking in data from web pages and restructuring it into a format that'll be useful for modeling

## Reflection
- **What was most interesting**
  - Learning how to use GitHub and publish our pages
- **How I'll apply this knowledge**
  - Using GitHub for collaborative projects in the future
