k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) &rarr; average distance to k closest events\n  - Distance to Specific Points &rarr; straight-line distance to important locations\n- Fixed Effects\n  - Categorical variables that capture all unmeasured characteristics of a group\n  - Helpful for situations where you cannot easily capture every aspect of a place's characteristics with defined variables\n  - Often, we'll see a large jump in R2 value when introducing fixed effects\n\n## Cross-Validation\n- Different types:\n  - Train/Test Splite &rarr; 80/20 split, simple but unstable method\n  - k-Fold Cross-Validation &rarr; split into k folds, train on k-1, test on 1, repeat across all \"folds\" allowing each to have a chance at being a training and testing dataset\n  - LOOCV &rarr; leave one observation out at a time (special case of k-fold)\n- k-Fold CV helps tell us how well models predict NEW data, is more honest than in-sample R2, and helps detect overfitting\n  - Categorical variables require that there's enough data in each category so that samples always include all examples of the categorical variable\n  - This makes k-Fold CV useful typically only in large datasets\n\n\n  \n  \n
