## Who We Are
![](midterm_presentation_files/TeamLogo.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

## Research Question and Motivation

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Research Question**

Identify which [predictors]{style="color:purple;"} (spatial, structural, and/or socio-economic) contribute to the most accurate model for the City's Automated Valuation Model
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Motivation**

Residential property tax assessments have [equitable and financial]{style="color:purple;"} implications for homeowners as well as [fiscal]{style="color:purple;"} implications for the city
:::

## Data Sources

-   [Property Sales]{style="color:purple;"} (Philadelphia, 2023-2024): City of Philadelphia - OpenDataPhilly
-   [Socio-Economics]{style="color:purple;"}: United States Census - American Community Survey
-   [Spatial Features]{style="color:purple;"}: City of Philadelphia - OpenDataPhilly

## Model Comparison

| Model   |       RMSE |       MAE |    R² |
|:--------|-----------:|----------:|------:|
| Model 1 | 230,140.41 | 15,174.13 | 0.287 |
| Model 2 | 215,430.39 | 90,217.97 | 0.380 |
| Model 3 | 211,021.39 | 90,144.74 | 0.405 |
| Model 4 | 196,081.17 | 71,582.45 | 0.490 |

: Model Performance Metrics {.striped .hover tbl-left}

-   [Model 1]{style="color:purple;"} (Structural) and [Model 2]{style="color:purple;"} (Structural + Census) had the worst performance.
-   [Spatial features]{style="color:purple;"} (Model 3) and [interaction terms]{style="color:purple;"} (Model 4) boosted model performance.

## Top Predictors 

::: {.column width="20%"}
- In a wealthy neighborhood ($\beta$ = 50,306.450, p \< 0.01)
- Number of bedrooms ($\beta$ = 33,544.290, p \< 0.01)
- Number of bathrooms ($\beta$ = 29,510.940, p \< 0.01)

## Model Performance

![](midterm_presentation_files/Final_Model_CV_Scatter.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}


## Hardest to Predict

-   [Northeast]{style="color:purple;"} and [West]{style="color:purple;"} Philly are hardest to predict due to the low income neighborhood limitation of our model

## Recommendations  
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="80%"}
:::

::: {.column width="20%" style="text-align:left;"}
- Policymakers should be aware that houses in lower-income neighborhoods will not be accurately predicted by this model
- Physical features of a structure such as the number of bedrooms/bathrooms serve as strong predictors of home sale price. Nearby attractive amenities such as proximity to transit stations as well as distance from crime also contribute.

## Limitations & Next Steps

<!-- :::: columns -->
<!-- ::: {.column width="20%" style="text-align:left;"} -->
**Limitations**

-   Philadelphia sale prices don't have a linear relationship, particularly among lower-priced homes
-   Variables used were aggregated and not weighted

**Next Steps**

-   Update the model to account for lower neighborhoods and tailor spatial features to add texture and depth to the model
