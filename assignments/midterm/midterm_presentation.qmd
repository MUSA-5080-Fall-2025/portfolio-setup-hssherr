## Research Question and Motivation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Research Question

Identify which [predictors]{style="color:purple;"} (spatial, structural, and/or socio-economic) contribute to the most accurate model for the City's Automated Valuation Model
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Motivation

Residential property tax assessments have [equitable and financial]{style="color:purple;"} implications for homeowners as well as [fiscal]{style="color:purple;"} implications for the city

## Model Comparison
| Model | RMSE | MAE | R² |
|:------|----------:|---------:|---------:|
| Model 1 | 230,140.41 | 15,174.13 | 0.287 |
| Model 2 | 215,430.39 | 90,217.97 | 0.380 |
| Model 3 | 211,021.39 | 90,144.74 | 0.405 |
| Model 4 | 196,081.17 | 1,582.45 | 0.490 |

: Model Performance Metrics {.striped .hover tbl-left}

- Model 1 (Structural) and Model 2 (Structural + Census) had the worst performance.
- Spatial features (Model 3) and interaction terms (Model 4) boosted model performance.

## Recommendations  
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="80%"}
:::

::: {.column width="20%" style="text-align:left;"}
- Policymakers should be aware that houses in lower-income neighborhoods will not be accurately predicted by this model
- Physical features of a structure such as the number of bedrooms/bathrooms serve as strong predictors of home sale price. Nearby attractive amenities such as proximity to transit stations as well as distance from crime also contribute.

## Limitations & Next Steps

::: {.column width="80%"}
![](midterm_presentation_files/TLAbig.jpg){fig-align="center" width=80%}
:::

::: {.column width="20%" style="text-align:left;"}
**Limitations**

- Philadelphia sale prices don't have a linear relationship, particularly among lower-priced homes
- Variables used were aggregated and not weighted
