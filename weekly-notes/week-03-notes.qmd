## Data Visualization
- Anscombe's Quartet &rarr; four datasets with identical summary statistics, but in various formats (linear, scattered, parabolic, and concentrated)
- Visualizing how data is arranged is just as important as knowing the statistics behind datasets in order to see these differences
  - Summary statistics can hide critical patterns
  - Outliers may represent important communities
  - Relationships aren’t always linear
  - Visual inspection reveals data quality issues
- ACS data is inherently unreliable, and bad visualizations have real consequences
  - Misleading scales/axes
  - Cherry-picked time periods
  - Hidden or ignored uncertainty
  - Missing context about data reliability

## Grammar of Graphics
- When making a ggplot, the elements go as follows:
  - Data &rarr; what is your dataset?
  - Aesthetics &rarr; what variables map to visual properties?
  - Geometries &rarr; how do you want to display the data?
  - Additional Layers &rarr; scales, themes, facets, annotations, etc.
  - Broadly:
    - ggplot(data = your_data) +
      - aes(x = variable1, y = variable2) +
      - geom_something() +
      - additional_layers()
  
- Arguments
  - x, y &rarr; position
  - color &rarr; point/line color
  - fill &rarr; area fill color
  - size &rarr; point/line size
  - shape &rarr; point shape
  - alpha &rarr; transparency
  - **Aethetics go inside `aes()`, constants go outside**
  - Aesthetics are not for decorating, they are for changing data-related elements of your plot (WILL BE ON QUIZ)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- It's like detective work:
  - What does the data look like? (distributions, missing values)
  - What patterns exist? (relationships, clusters, trends)
  - What’s unusual? (outliers, anomalies, data quality issues)
  - What questions does this raise? (hypotheses for further investigation)
  - How reliable is this data?

## R Tips from This Week
- The `regex()` function can generate regex expressions based on a string input.
